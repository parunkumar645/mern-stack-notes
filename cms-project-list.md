## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s digital age, managing and organizing content efficiently is crucial for businesses, organizations, and individuals. Traditional methods of content management are often manual, time-consuming, and lack scalability. There is a growing need for a Content Management System (CMS) that can streamline content creation, organization, and distribution while providing a seamless user experience. The system should be flexible enough to cater to various domains, such as education, healthcare, e-commerce, and more, while ensuring features like user authentication, content visibility, media management, and analytics are integrated seamlessly.

The goal is to develop a CMS platform that allows users to create, manage, and publish content efficiently, with features tailored to specific use cases. The system should support multiple user roles, provide robust content management capabilities, and offer advanced functionalities like SEO optimization, analytics, and notifications. Additionally, the platform should be scalable, secure, and user-friendly to meet the diverse 
needs of its users.
